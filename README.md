## File structure
Each folder has own README.
- `Vagrantfile`: Configuration file to install vertual machine, The Vagrant VM, which includes PostgreSQL
- `tournament`: A PostgreSQL project
- `sqlalchemy_sample`: A sqlalchemy project
- `webserver`: BaseHTTPServer project, using sqlalchemy
- `flask`: Flask framework project
- `oauth`: Sample for Google account login 
- `project`: unit3 final project 


## Setup
1. Power up the VM 
Run the following in the directory where Vagrantfile locates:
```
vagrant up
```
To turn the virtual machine off type `vagrant halt`.
2. Log in to the VM.
```
vagrant ssh
```
To log out, type `exit`

It is important to turn off/log out property especially when you run vagrant in different directories.


## Port handling
`Vagrantfile` handles Vagrant installation and port forwarding as the following:
```
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8000, host: 8000, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5000, host: 5000, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"
  ...
end
```
Other useful command around port:
- To see what vagrant instances are running: `vagrant global-status`
- To see which application is holding ports: `lsof -i | grep LISTEN`
